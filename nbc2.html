            <h2>My Role as a Desktop Support Analyst at National Bank (Sept. - Dec. 2023)</h2>

            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                For my second internship, I have been fortunate to extend my contract for National Bank as a Desktop Support Analyst.
                Here I will share you more of what I have learned and experienced in my role during the fall term.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>My objectives during this work term</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                For the new term, I created a new set of three goals:
            </p>
            <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <li>Learn how to troubleshoot IT issues through problem solving</li>
                <li>Know where to find information that can be used to help solve issues and for self-learning</li>
                <li>Develop teamwork skills in order to tackle complex issues which can't be handled alone</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            <h4>The use of problem solving</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Troubleshooting and problem solving go hand in hand when solving IT issues.
                You will encounter cases where the issue is not as straightforward as it seems, and will require you to break
                the problem down into steps in order to find the root cause of the issue.
                <br><br>
                As a computer science student, I was able to transfer my debugging skills from programming to help me find the root causes of
                issues in tickets. For example, when troubleshooting a monitor issue, you usually bring a test computer to test the monitor.
                If the test computer is able to display to the monitor, then it is an issue with the user's computer. Else, if it is unable
                to display to the monitor, then it is an issue with the cable or the monitor itself.
                <br><br>
                In many cases, oral communication is the main method used in problem solving. The best way to get the information you need 
                in order solve the issue is from the user themself. Sometimes, the information stated in the ticket may not be descriptive 
                or clear enough for you to be able to fully understand the situation.
                <br><br>
                Communication is mainly done through questioning. You need to know how to ask the right questions in order to get the right 
                information out of a user. Common general ones include; when the issue started occurring, if it occurred in the past, and if 
                they experience it working from home or at the office. 
                <br><br>
                Once you have gathered enough information, you can use it to narrow down on what the cause of the issue is and how to resolve
                it. For example, recurring computer crashes may result in the user needing a replacement, or if a user experiences slowness 
                working from home, then they may need to reboot their home router. You can also use the information to replicate the same 
                issue on a test computer which can help with troubleshooting. 
                <br><br>
                When the issue gets more complicated, you would have to start asking more 
                specific questions, such as how often they shut down their computer, which is often related to slowness and blue screen issues. 
                Effective communication goes a long way, as there are times when the issue can be resolved without any need for physical 
                involvement. 
                <br><br>
                If the issue cannot be resolved remotely, you would have to ask the user to come in physically to the shop so that you are 
                able to have a first-hand look at the issue yourself. This helps clear up any ambiguity in what the user has communicated to you 
                since often times what they say may be miscommunicated or even false, so it is best to experience it for yourself and confirm
                with your own eyes.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>Googling is a skill</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                There may be times when you are not knowledgeable enough to solve an issue. This is where search engines like Google can
                come in handy. Like in programming, many issues you will encounter have often been encountered already before and are 
                documented online.
                <br><br>
                Googling is an essential skill in IT, as it is your main resource for troubleshooting issues when they become outside of
                your scope. Improving your Googling skills can not only help make troubleshooting more quicker, easier, and efficient, but
                it can also help make you more independent and less reliant on your co-workers when solving an issue wherein the solution 
                can easily be found online.
                <br><br>
                There is no shame in having to look up information, as new issues are brought up on a day-to-day basis, which makes it
                difficult to keep up with every single piece of information. We usually document every step of our troubleshooting process
                within each ticket so that we can look back to them if a similar issue comes up again in the future.
                <br><br>
                We also document our findings on our corporate wiki which is usually where we go to first to look for information before
                Googling, especially if it's a Bank-only issue. This is important for recurring issues so that people would not waste time
                asking each other for help or Googling for a solution. 
                <br><br>
                When there was an overheating crisis for Dell computers, we made 
                documentation on a step-by-step guide on how to resolve them, which minimized the downtime whenever this issue occurred.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>Teamwork makes the dream work</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Working in IT heavily involves teamwork and cooperation from all members. Since each person has varying degrees of knowledge
                and expertise, helping each other out makes the job more quick and efficient, and in turn we can learn from each other and
                improve ourselves for the better.
                <br><br>
                But often times it is not always the case that issues can be resolved only by one team. Within the IT department, there are various
                teams we work with that each have their own speciality or field of expertise which they can lend to help us resolve any issue.
                Solving tickets is a team effort, as many issues require the use of different skills.
                <br><br>
                For example, if the issue involves dealing with user accesses for Microsoft apps such as Outlook, we work with the Microsoft Admin team.
                Or if the issue involves dealing with corporate phone activation, we work with the Mobile team.
                <br><br>
                In this term, I have experienced being apart of several major projects which took the collaboration of multiple teams to accomplish. 
                One was a phone enrollment procedure where we assisted users with setting up and enrolling their phones so that they are compliant 
                with the Bank. Another was a desk move where I assisted the IT trading support team with moving and setting up users' computers 
                and monitors.
                <br><br>
                Knowing which team to work with when tackling IT issues outside of your scope is key to solving them efficiently and effectively.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>What I have learned from this job (in the fall)</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since I stayed working for National Bank, I got to experience more of what it is like working in tech support, as well as become apart
                of several major projects as mentioned earlier, including the phone enrollment and the desk move.
                <br><br>
                I got to continue expanding my knowledge of computer hardware and Windows, as well as learn more about the backend and what
                goes on behind the scenes within other teams, such as in the Microsoft Admin team. I also got to continue developing my customer 
                service skills, and learn how to deal with more difficult clients.
                <br><br>
                By working with other teams, I got to be more involved in work outside of my comfort zone. I especially got more exposure working
                with the IT trading support team where I learned how to deal with a different user base, and how to deal with their requests which
                differ from the ones I'm normally used to handling.
                <br><br>
                One of the points I had emphasized in my previous work term report is company culture, which is a strength of the Bank. My experience
                throughout the term has reinforced this point as almost everyone I had worked with, including my co-workers and clients, left me with
                positive feelings.
                <br><br>
                Everyone was very nice and easy to work with. People are also generally very appreciative of the work I do for them. 
                It is the one aspect of this job which I will never forget.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, I am glad I had decided to continue working at National Bank for the fall term. I have gained much more exposure to IT which I wouldn't 
                have if I had decided not to stay, and additionally I got to further improve the skills I had acquired in the previous term.
                <br><br>
                I love the culture of this company, and I am happy that I got the chance to continue working with my co-workers, and meet many new people as well. 
                <br><br>
                I will definitely miss working here, and I look forward for what's in store for me in the future as I continue down my career pathway.
