            <p>
                For my first internship, I have been fortunate to work for National Bank as a Desktop Support Analyst during my summer term.
                Here I will share you my thoughts about my experience, what I have learned, and about the company and my role.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>What is National Bank?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                National Bank is one of the leading major banks in Canada and the largest in Quebec.
                It is headquartered in Montreal, and has a branch in Toronto which is where I worked at.
                <br><br>
                They provide financial services for their clients, and ensure that their financial goals are met. 
                What makes this company stand out is their focus on building relationships with their clients and making a positive impact on their lives.
                <br><br>
                The company is deeply integrated with technology as it plays a major role in their day-to-day operations and in how they provide their services.
                They heavily rely on the use of artificial intelligence and the cloud.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>What is a Desktop Support Analyst?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                The role of a Desktop Support Analyst is to provide IT support for users in the company 
                to minimize downtime in order to ensure that operations run as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
                <br><br>
                Support is provided on-site at the IT Shop and remotely. IT requests made by users go through a ticketing system 
                which is managed and handled by various support teams. Users can also drop by the shop if an issue is urgent or if they 
                need support physically.
                <br><br>
                IT issues can range from software installations and printer configurations, to overheating computers and blue screen errors.
                We also provide replacement and loaner computers depending on the severity of the situation.
                <br><br>
                To be good at the job, not only do you have to be tech savvy, but you also need to be a quick learner, and be good dealing with customers.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>My objectives during this work term</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                At the beginning of my internship, I created a set of three goals I hoped to achieve by the end of the term:
            </p>
            <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <li>Learn about the software used in my job to troubleshoot IT issues</li>
                <li>Improving my oral communication when interacting with my co-workers and clients</li>
                <li>Understanding how computer science and IT is applied in the workplace environment</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            <h4>Learning technical skills on the job</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, being a quick learner is an asset to this job. 
                In the world of IT, there is always something new to learn, and in support you will always encounter new issues on a daily basis.
                <br><br>
                You have to be quick and adaptive to whatever situation you encounter. If you don't know how to solve an issue, it is necessary to ask for help
                from your colleagues and from other teams. If the issue is frequent enough, there may be documentation on it from the corporate wiki (we use Confluence).
                In the worst case scenario, Google is your best friend.
                <br><br>
                As a computer science student, I was able to transfer several skills to my work, such as my quick learning ability from learning programming languages, 
                my debugging skills from coding to troubleshooting issues in IT since they both require the need to find
                the root cause of the issue, and my familiarity with Windows (especially with the use of the command prompt).
                <br><br>
                At National Bank, we use a combination of in-house and Microsoft software to solve our IT issues, such as Command Prompt for refreshing group policy and 
                software installations, Endpoint Configuration Manager for remoting into users' computers, and Active Directory to lookup and modify user profile information.
                <br><br>
                Because of my transferrable skills, I was able to be comfortable using the software provided by the company fairly quickly. Applying the tools I have to 
                solving IT issues was much more challenging, but with help from my colleagues and using Google, I was eventually able to handle tickets on my own.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>The importance of oral communication</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Another part of IT support is to be good dealing with customers. This is where oral communication comes in. Not only is it an essential skill to help
                you interact with your co-workers, but also with your clients.
                <br><br>
                Communication is the forefront of IT support, and it is usually the determinant of if an issue gets resolved. Good communication can help make troubleshooting
                issues more quick and efficient, which means they will get resolved faster. This results in customer satisfaction because of less downtime, and it also helps free
                up time for us to handle other tickets. 
                <br><br>
                Sometimes there are cases where the client does not know exactly what their issue is or how to properly communicate it. In one ticket I recieved, the client requested 
                for a software installation, but it turned out that they did not know what they needed the software for, and it ended up becoming a separate issue of user privilleges.
                This is an example of where good communication can help resolve a seemingly complicated issue.
                <br><br>
                In order to establish good communication with your customer, you must first and foremost be professional and considerate of them so that they will treat you
                in the same manner. When they tell you what their issue is, you may need to ask them questions to help get clarification so that you are able to troubleshoot and 
                find the cause. Once you figure out a solution, you need to be able to break down the steps you will take to resolve their issue in comprehensible terms,
                so that they understand how it is resolved.
                <br><br>
                This was mostly a challenge for me since I did not have much practical experience with communication at school. But throughout my internship, I was able to 
                become more confident with my speaking abilities the more I interacted with my colleagues and my clients. As a result, I was able to be more comfortable 
                interacting with people in general.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>How technology plays a role in the company</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also wanted to learn how IT is applied in the real world by working at a company. Because of my role, I got to work with various teams in IT and see what they do. 
                Within IT support as mentioned earlier, we were in charge of providing technical support for users, especially for other teams in IT such as developers. 
                <br><br>
                Within the IT department, there are various support teams which are specialized to handle different types of requests. Help desk or Level 1 is the first reach of contact 
                and where tickets usually go to first. Any tickets they cannot handle or are more complicated go to Level 2 which is where I work in. If there are still tickets that even 
                we cannot handle, then we send them to other specialized teams or Level 3. 
                <br><br>
                I was also fortunate enough to meet with other teams in IT outside of direct support. One was a sysadmin team who was in charge of backend support of Microsoft 
                applications, such as tracking emails in Outlook and user devices in Azure. Another was a developer team who was in charge of
                developing in-house applications for the company.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>What I have learned from this job (as an intern)</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Coming out of my first internship, I have definitely learned and experienced a lot of things you wouldn't normally get at school. It is where you
                get the chance to apply the theory and skills you have learned in the real world to gain practical experience. Internships also help 
                with self-discovery as you get to see if the job is to your liking, and it affirms your career pathway.
                <br><br>
                With my specific role, I got to apply my knowledge in computer science into a field where it is deeply rooted in, and learn more about how 
                computers work and what they are used for outside of software development.
                <br><br>
                I got to learn more about computer hardware, Windows as an operating system, how to troubleshoot various IT issues that occur within Windows, 
                and how to use Microsoft and company software to resolve them. Outside of technical skills, I also got to learn how to work in customer support 
                and develop my communication, teamwork, and problem solving skills, all of which are transferrable. 
                <br><br>
                Lastly, I got to learn and experience how the corporate world works, with the way you present yourself and interact with others (especially with 
                your manager), joining meetings and on calls, and receiving and sending emails on a daily basis. 
                <br><br>
                One thing I have learned in the corporate world that I didn't expect to have much importance is company culture and how it matters in your 
                day-to-day work life, which people may take for granted. Company culture influences how people act towards each other, which not only affects your 
                work, but also your well-being.
                <br><br>
                One of the company's biggest strengths is its culture. It has values in place that always put people first, thus making it a very inclusive and 
                welcoming environment. People are generally laidback and casual, and act friendly towards each other while maintaining a sense of professionalism, 
                without being overly strict.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, working at National Bank was a great experience. I have learned a lot of valuable skills which will benefit me in the future,
                and I have learned a lot about myself and my career pathway. 
                <br><br>
                I learned a lot about technology that I wouldn't have at school, and it gave me the chance to indulge in my passion in IT while helping to benefit 
                a company. 
                <br><br>
                I enjoyed working with the people here as its culture is very welcoming, which added to my overall experience. 
                <br><br>
                It is the best first internship experience I could have ever asked for, and I hope to return back again in the near future.
            </p>
